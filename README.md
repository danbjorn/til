# Today I Learned

A repository of little tips and tricks I've picked up. Inspired by [https://til.simonwillison.net/](https://til.simonwillison.net/).

Created so I don't forget all the little things I learn and maybe help someone else. Also an excuse to play with [datasette](https://datasette.io/).

## Todo

* Add per-TIL pages
* Only show the X most recent TILs
* Paging
* Filter by topic
* Propose patch for markdown-to-sqlite for extenstions so I don't have to effectively vendor it
