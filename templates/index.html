        <p>This is a collection of little facts and tips that I come across. Mostly
        this is so I don't forget things, but they're public in the hope that they
        may be of use. The site was inspired by
        <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison's TIL site</a>, and
        is powered by <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>. You can see the
        code behind this article at
