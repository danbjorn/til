title: Reversing a `range`
---
`range` objects have an `__reversed__` attribute, which means that you can use them with
`reversed()` without having to instantiate the list, e.g.

```python
for index in reversed(range(5)):
```

Note that this is not true of `enumerate()` objects - to reverse an enumerated iterator
you have to consume the whole thing first. This means if you want to iterate through
something in reverse with indexes, itâ€™s best to do something like:

```python
for index in reversed(range(len(data))):
    item = data[index]
```

Although this feels super ugly so I'm curious if there's an alternate option. It is
possible, if somewhat unwieldy, to make use of `zip()` to get it on one line:

```python
for index, item in zip(reversed(range(len(data))), reversed(data)):
```

You could also muck around with `itertools.count()` or something to remove the extra
`reversed()`:

```python
for index, item in zip(count(len(data)-1, -1), reversed(data)):
```

But I don't think that's much better. Open to suggestions.
